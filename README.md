# Towards a Computational Literary Science

Data-driven analysis has emerged as a growing methodology, if not sub-discipline within literary studies. This approach, broadly described as “distant reading”, has harnessed available technology to open new avenues for how we understand literary texts, both individually and in the aggregate. Whereas traditional literary scholarship is generally grounded in the interpretation of the specific language of a text or body of texts, macroanalytic approaches have offered new ways of seeing texts. This interdisciplinary research project at the Victoria University of Wellington is an attempt to theorise the relationship between macroanalytic and microanalytic (distant and close) readings of individual works.
